# Chocola's Expenses App
Expenses tracking app made in React

Just experimentations from a React course somewhere.

## Tools used:
- React 18
- Redux Toolkit
- React Router 6
- React Datepicker
- Jest (Tests broken and not fixed after lots of refactoring)
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase Authentification (using Google)
- SASS (SCSS)
- Webpack
- Express (Just for index.html serving)

# Demo

Demo hosted on https://choco-expenses.onrender.com/ .
There was a demo hosted on Heroku but since they are turning off free dynos, it was changed to Render (kinda slow but still works)
